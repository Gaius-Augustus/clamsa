# Things to do
 - [ ] 1) Generate training and test sets for human, fly.
 - [ ] 2) Reproduce the fly results from the talk in January with the new code.
 - [ ] 3) Check accuracy on human when trained on human and compare to fly (training & prediction).
 - [ ] 4) Compute cross-training accuracy human version on fly test set and fly version on human test set.  
 - [ ] 5) Train wth a mixed human and fly training set and evaluate on human and fly test set.
 - [ ] 6) Conditaional on relative success: Compile set of labeled plant alignments, tree and training and test sets.
